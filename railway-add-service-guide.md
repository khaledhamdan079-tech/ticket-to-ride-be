# Railway - How to Add Database Service

## Method 1: Project Dashboard

1. **Go to your Railway project:**

2. **Look for one of these:**
   - **"Add Service" button** (usually at the top)
   - **"+" button** (plus icon)
   - **"New Service" button**
   - **"Create Service" button**

3. **Click it and select:**
   - **"Database"** → **"PostgreSQL"**

## Method 2: Services Tab

1. **Click on "Services" tab** in your project
2. **Look for "Add Service" or "+" button**
3. **Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"**

## Method 3: Project Menu

1. **Look for a menu button** (three dots or hamburger menu)
2. **Select "Add Service" or "New Service"**
3. **Choose "Database" → "PostgreSQL"**

## Method 4: If You Can't Find It

1. **Try refreshing the page**
